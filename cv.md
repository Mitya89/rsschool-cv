## __About me:__
I work in area of wastewater treatment as process engineer, but IT-industry is also very interesting to me. That is why I decided to get new knowledge and to expand my skills in area of Javascript frontend development.
I like the movie «The Pursuit of Happiness» . There is a phrase in it, said by the main character, which corresponds to my attitude to work, and not only to it:
«I am the type of a person that if you ask me a question and I do not know the answer, I am gonna tell you that I do not know. But I bet you what, I know how to find the answer and I will find it».
